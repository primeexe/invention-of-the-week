so basically, the idea is on sunday it reminds people to post so on sunday and monday they can post picture andf videos of their project and then after monday they cant post anything but they can send messages, this only applies to the single channel obvs, and then on thursday it remindss again as thursday and friday it lets you post pics and vids again to show what you have done since the monday and u show the progress. so then on saturday theres a vote in the channel of who made the most progress, and by sunday morning the winner gets a gold name for the inventor of the week and they keep that until the next sunday when the colour will be given to the new winner. sound ok?
